# Zervi MRP Application Integration Request Package

## Project Overview

We are implementing a Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) system for Zervi, a vertically integrated textile manufacturer. We have received a complete codebase from Manus.im containing models, controllers, and routes for the MRP functionality, and we need assistance integrating these components with our existing application structure.

## Current State

1. **Original Manus Files**
   - Located at: `C:\Users\Archie\Desktop\Coding Projects\Manufacturing MRP App Original Manus files\home\ubuntu\mrp-app`
   - Contains complete backend implementation with 45+ entity models
   - Includes controllers and routes for all core MRP functionality
   - Follows TypeORM architecture with proper relationship management

2. **Current Project Implementation**
   - Located at: `C:\Users\Archie\Desktop\Coding Projects\Manufacturing MRP Application Development Request`
   - Contains basic foundation: authentication, company, division, and user models
   - Frontend UI previews have been created (HTML/CSS/JS)
   - No MRP-specific functionality yet implemented

3. **Analysis Documentation**
   - We've created an analysis document: `manus_implementation_analysis.md`
   - Identified key components in the Manus implementation
   - Documented missing functionality in our current project

## Components to Implement

From our analysis, we need to implement the following components:

1. **Item Management**
   - Model: `item.model.ts`
   - Controller: `item.controller.ts`
   - Routes: `item.routes.ts`
   - Functionality: Create, read, update, delete operations for inventory items

2. **Bill of Materials (BOM) Management**
   - Models: `bom.model.ts` and `bom-component.model.ts`
   - Controller: `bom.controller.ts`
   - Routes: `bom.routes.ts`
   - Functionality: Multi-level BOM structure with component management

3. **Manufacturing Order Management**
   - Models: `manufacturing-order.model.ts` and `manufacturing-order-operation.model.ts`
   - Controller: `manufacturing-order.controller.ts`
   - Routes: `manufacturing-order.routes.ts`
   - Functionality: Production planning, scheduling, and execution

4. **Specialized Operations**
   - Models: `laminating-operation.model.ts`, `cutting-operation.model.ts`, `sewing-operation.model.ts`
   - Controllers: Implementation needed (not found in Manus codebase)
   - Routes: Implementation needed (not found in Manus codebase)
   - Functionality: Textile-specific manufacturing operations

5. **Inter-Division Transfers**
   - Models: `inter-division-transfer.model.ts` and `inter-division-transfer-item.model.ts`
   - Controller: `inter-division-transfer.controller.ts`
   - Routes: Implementation needed
   - Functionality: Material transfers between company divisions

## Technical Architecture

The MRP application follows a standard Node.js/Express/TypeORM backend architecture:

1. **Database**
   - PostgreSQL database
   - TypeORM for ORM functionality
   - Extensive relationships between entities

2. **Backend Structure**
   - Models: TypeORM entities with proper relationships
   - Controllers: Business logic with transaction management
   - Routes: RESTful API endpoints with authentication
   - Middleware: Authentication and role-based access control

3. **Frontend**
   - React-based UI (to be implemented)
   - API service clients
   - Component-based architecture

## Implementation Challenges

1. **Entity Relationships**
   - Need to ensure proper relationships between entities
   - Foreign key constraints must be maintained
   - Transaction management for complex operations

2. **Multi-Level Structures**
   - BOM supports multi-level component structures
   - Manufacturing orders can have parent-child relationships
   - Need to handle recursive relationship queries

3. **Specialized Operations**
   - Textile-specific operations (laminating, cutting, sewing)
   - Different parameters and workflows for each operation type
   - Need to integrate with manufacturing orders

## Specific Implementation Requests

1. **Phase 1: Core Entities**
   - Implement Item and BOM models with controllers and routes
   - Ensure proper transaction management
   - Update API routes to include new endpoints

2. **Phase 2: Manufacturing Orders**
   - Implement manufacturing order models and controllers
   - Create operation management functionality
   - Link with BOM components for material requirements

3. **Phase 3: Specialized Operations**
   - Implement models for textile operations
   - Create controllers for operation management
   - Integrate with manufacturing order system

4. **Phase 4: Integration & Testing**
   - Connect frontend components with API endpoints
   - Ensure proper data flow between components
   - Test complete workflows
