## Risk Management

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Integration complexity | High | High | Start with small components, use feature flags |
| Database schema misalignment | Medium | High | Verify schema before integration, create migration tests |
| Frontend-backend compatibility | Medium | Medium | Define clear API contracts, implement comprehensive testing |
| Performance issues | Medium | Medium | Regular performance testing, optimize early |
| Scope creep | High | Medium | Maintain strict backlog, prioritize features |

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All components are properly integrated
2. The application passes all tests
3. The UI is responsive and user-friendly
4. API response times meet performance targets
5. Documentation is complete and accurate

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions (Next 48 Hours)**
