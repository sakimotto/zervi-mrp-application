## Database Implementation

The database schema has been implemented using PostgreSQL with the following structure:

1. **Core Tables (01_core_tables.sql)**
   - Companies, Divisions - Organizational structure
   - Users, Roles - Authentication and authorization

2. **Inventory Tables (02_inventory_tables.sql)**
   - Items and Item Categories
   - Units of Measurement
   - Warehouses and Storage Locations

3. **BOM Tables (03_bom_tables.sql)**
   - Bills of Materials (BOMs) with versioning
   - BOM Components - Specifies items and quantities

4. **Operations Tables (04_operations_tables.sql)**
   - Routings - Production sequences
   - Work Centers and Workstations
   - Operations - General and specialized

5. **Manufacturing Orders (05_manufacturing_orders.sql)**
   - Manufacturing Orders - Production planning
   - Work Orders - Production execution

6. **Costs and Transfers (06_costs_and_transfers.sql)**
   - Costing Models and Rates
   - Inter-Division Transfers

## Frontend Implementation

The frontend implementation is based on React and includes:

1. **API Services:**
   - Service definitions for all backend endpoints
   - Authentication handling with token management

2. **UI Components:**
   - Original implementation available in Manus files
   - Visual references available in zervi-ui-preview

3. **Integration Status:**
   - API services defined
   - **Pending:** Integration of React components
   - **Pending:** Connection to backend endpoints

## Next Implementation Steps

### 1. Backend Consolidation
- Move all models to `backend/src/models/`
- Ensure proper imports and references
- Update TypeORM configuration to include all entities

### 2. Phase Integration
- Complete Phase 4 implementation
- Integrate all phases into a cohesive backend

### 3. Frontend Integration
- Integrate React components from original Manus files
- Connect to backend API endpoints

### 4. Testing
- Implement comprehensive testing for all endpoints
- Verify frontend-backend integration
