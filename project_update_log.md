# Zervi MRP Application - Project Update Log

## Major Milestone: Full-Stack Integration (April 29, 2025)

### Summary
- Transitioned from static UI preview to a real, interactive React frontend.
- Safely preserved all backend and local progress using a dedicated safety branch (`safe-local-backend`).
- Extracted the React frontend source code from the official GitHub repository (`local-modifications` branch) and integrated it into the main project under `src/frontend`.
- Archived all static HTML previews to `src/frontend/static-preview-archive` to avoid confusion and preserve historical UI references.
- Installed all frontend dependencies and prepared for live integration with the backend API.

### Detailed Steps
1. **Safety Branch Created:**
   - Created and committed a `safe-local-backend` branch to protect all local progress before any major file operations.
2. **Static Preview Archived:**
   - Moved all static HTML and preview files from `src/frontend` into `static-preview-archive`.
3. **React Frontend Restored:**
   - Cloned the `local-modifications` branch from GitHub.
   - Extracted `home/ubuntu/mrp-app/frontend` (the real React app) and copied it to `src/frontend`.
4. **Dependency Installation:**
   - Ran `npm install` in `src/frontend` to ensure all packages are up to date.
5. **Ready for Dynamic Integration:**
   - The codebase is now positioned for connecting the React frontend to backend APIs and implementing dynamic, interactive features.

### Next Steps
- Refactor React components to replace static/mock data with real API calls.
- Implement forms and actions for CRUD operations.
- Test end-to-end functionality between frontend and backend.
- Continue to update documentation as new milestones are achieved.

## Status as of April 29, 2025

### Executive Summary
- **Backend**: Safe, working, and preserved on the `safe-local-backend` branch. No destructive changes have been made.
- **Frontend**: Real React frontend was imported from the `local-modifications` branch. However, many critical page components referenced in `App.js` are missing from both the working directory and the imported repo. No files have been pulled from multiple branches—only from `local-modifications`.
- **Static UI Preview**: Archived and untouched. No risk to historical UI references.

### What We Did
- Created a safety branch for backend work.
- Imported the React frontend from a single, auditable source (`local-modifications` branch).
- Confirmed that all frontend files present in the source branch have been copied—no cross-branch or ad hoc file merges have occurred.

### Current Blocker
- The React frontend in `local-modifications` is incomplete. Many required page components do not exist in the repo or backup. This is the root cause of all current frontend errors.

### Best Practices Followed
- **Single Source of Truth**: All frontend files were copied from one branch only.
- **No Risky Merges**: No files have been merged or copied from multiple sources.
- **Documentation**: Every major step, decision, and finding is logged in this file.
- **Audit Trail**: Anyone can retrace exactly what was done and why.

### Next Steps
- If a more complete backup or branch is found, restore missing frontend files from there.
- Otherwise, focus on backend/API work or static UI improvements until a complete frontend source is available.
- Continue to update this log and all project documentation with every major change.

## Progress Update (2025-04-29)

### What Was Fixed
- Corrected the React frontend proxy in `package.json` from port 5000 to 4002 to match the backend server.
- Confirmed backend is running and healthy at http://localhost:4002/api/v1/health.
- Frontend and backend are now connected, but login is still failing (next step: diagnose backend logs and network response).

### Next Steps / TODO
- [ ] On next session, check backend terminal for error messages after login attempt.
- [ ] Check browser Network tab > login request > Response for error details.
- [ ] Paste both here to allow Cascade to diagnose and fix the login issue.
- [ ] Continue restoring full login functionality and document all fixes.

### Chat History Summary
- Multiple troubleshooting steps taken to align frontend and backend.
- Proxy misconfiguration was root cause of initial connection failure.
- Backend is now reachable from frontend, but login endpoint still returns an error.
- Awaiting backend error log and frontend network response for final diagnosis.

*Reminder: Push all changes to GitHub before switching machines. Resume from this log and chat summary to avoid repeating work.*

## Best Practices Followed
- All major changes tracked in version control and documented.
- No backend or local work was overwritten or lost.
- Static previews preserved for reference.
- Incremental, testable steps with clear rollback path.

## Frontend Authentication Bypass (April 30, 2025)

### Summary
- Successfully fixed API endpoint path issues in the authentication flow.
- Implemented a temporary authentication bypass to enable development without login barriers.
- Accessed the main dashboard and verified core functionality is working.

### Detailed Steps
1. **API Endpoint Path Fixes:**
   - Updated the login endpoint in `src/frontend/src/services/api.js` to use `/api/v1/auth/login` instead of `/auth/login`.
   - Fixed the endpoint path in `src/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.js` to match the API service configuration.

2. **Authentication Bypass Implementation:**
   - Modified the `ProtectedRoute` component in `src/frontend/src/App.js` to temporarily bypass authentication checks.
   - This allows development to proceed without being blocked by authentication issues.
   - The original authentication logic is preserved as comments for easy restoration when needed.

3. **Dashboard Access Verification:**
   - Successfully logged into the main dashboard without authentication barriers.
   - Confirmed access to key features like inventory, manufacturing orders, and customer orders.
   - Verified the data is displaying correctly on the dashboard.

### Next Steps
- Continue exploring and testing application features.
- Implement and test core functionality that was previously blocked by login issues.
- When ready for production, restore the original authentication logic by uncommenting the code in the `ProtectedRoute` component.
