# Zervi MRP Application - Project Update Log

## Major Milestone: Full-Stack Integration (April 29, 2025)

### Summary
- Transitioned from static UI preview to a real, interactive React frontend.
- Safely preserved all backend and local progress using a dedicated safety branch (`safe-local-backend`).
- Extracted the React frontend source code from the official GitHub repository (`local-modifications` branch) and integrated it into the main project under `src/frontend`.
- Archived all static HTML previews to `src/frontend/static-preview-archive` to avoid confusion and preserve historical UI references.
- Installed all frontend dependencies and prepared for live integration with the backend API.

### Detailed Steps
1. **Safety Branch Created:**
   - Created and committed a `safe-local-backend` branch to protect all local progress before any major file operations.
2. **Static Preview Archived:**
   - Moved all static HTML and preview files from `src/frontend` into `static-preview-archive`.
3. **React Frontend Restored:**
   - Cloned the `local-modifications` branch from GitHub.
   - Extracted `home/ubuntu/mrp-app/frontend` (the real React app) and copied it to `src/frontend`.
4. **Dependency Installation:**
   - Ran `npm install` in `src/frontend` to ensure all packages are up to date.
5. **Ready for Dynamic Integration:**
   - The codebase is now positioned for connecting the React frontend to backend APIs and implementing dynamic, interactive features.

### Next Steps
- Refactor React components to replace static/mock data with real API calls.
- Implement forms and actions for CRUD operations.
- Test end-to-end functionality between frontend and backend.
- Continue to update documentation as new milestones are achieved.

## Status as of April 29, 2025

### Executive Summary
- **Backend**: Safe, working, and preserved on the `safe-local-backend` branch. No destructive changes have been made.
- **Frontend**: Real React frontend was imported from the `local-modifications` branch. However, many critical page components referenced in `App.js` are missing from both the working directory and the imported repo. No files have been pulled from multiple branches—only from `local-modifications`.
- **Static UI Preview**: Archived and untouched. No risk to historical UI references.

### What We Did
- Created a safety branch for backend work.
- Imported the React frontend from a single, auditable source (`local-modifications` branch).
- Confirmed that all frontend files present in the source branch have been copied—no cross-branch or ad hoc file merges have occurred.

### Current Blocker
- The React frontend in `local-modifications` is incomplete. Many required page components do not exist in the repo or backup. This is the root cause of all current frontend errors.

### Best Practices Followed
- **Single Source of Truth**: All frontend files were copied from one branch only.
- **No Risky Merges**: No files have been merged or copied from multiple sources.
- **Documentation**: Every major step, decision, and finding is logged in this file.
- **Audit Trail**: Anyone can retrace exactly what was done and why.

### Next Steps
- If a more complete backup or branch is found, restore missing frontend files from there.
- Otherwise, focus on backend/API work or static UI improvements until a complete frontend source is available.
- Continue to update this log and all project documentation with every major change.

## Progress Update (2025-04-29)

### What Was Fixed
- Corrected the React frontend proxy in `package.json` from port 5000 to 4002 to match the backend server.
- Confirmed backend is running and healthy at http://localhost:4002/api/v1/health.
- Frontend and backend are now connected, but login is still failing (next step: diagnose backend logs and network response).

### Next Steps / TODO
- [ ] On next session, check backend terminal for error messages after login attempt.
- [ ] Check browser Network tab > login request > Response for error details.
- [ ] Paste both here to allow Cascade to diagnose and fix the login issue.
- [ ] Continue restoring full login functionality and document all fixes.

### Chat History Summary
- Multiple troubleshooting steps taken to align frontend and backend.
- Proxy misconfiguration was root cause of initial connection failure.
- Backend is now reachable from frontend, but login endpoint still returns an error.
- Awaiting backend error log and frontend network response for final diagnosis.

## Best Practices Followed
- All major changes tracked in version control and documented.
- No backend or local work was overwritten or lost.
- Static previews preserved for reference.
- Incremental, testable steps with clear rollback path.

## Frontend Authentication Bypass (April 30, 2025)

### Summary
- Successfully fixed API endpoint path issues in the authentication flow.
- Implemented a temporary authentication bypass to enable development without login barriers.
- Accessed the main dashboard and verified core functionality is working.

### Detailed Steps
1. **API Endpoint Path Fixes:**
   - Updated the login endpoint in `src/frontend/src/services/api.js` to use `/api/v1/auth/login` instead of `/auth/login`.
   - Fixed the endpoint path in `src/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.js` to match the API service configuration.

2. **Authentication Bypass Implementation:**
   - Modified the `ProtectedRoute` component in `src/frontend/src/App.js` to temporarily bypass authentication checks.
   - This allows development to proceed without being blocked by authentication issues.
   - The original authentication logic is preserved as comments for easy restoration when needed.

3. **Dashboard Access Verification:**
   - Successfully logged into the main dashboard without authentication barriers.
   - Confirmed access to key features like inventory, manufacturing orders, and customer orders.
   - Verified the data is displaying correctly on the dashboard.

### Next Steps
- Continue exploring and testing application features.
- Implement and test core functionality that was previously blocked by login issues.
- When ready for production, restore the original authentication logic by uncommenting the code in the `ProtectedRoute` component.

## Schema Alignment for Inventory Management (April 30, 2025)

### Summary
- Conducted comprehensive analysis across all branches to locate database schema components
- Found a well-designed and comprehensive SQL schema in `database/scripts/` on the main branch
- Identified gaps between existing schema and frontend inventory management requirements
- Created a detailed implementation plan to align backend schema with frontend features
- Established development priorities for the inventory management module

### Key Findings
1. **Existing Schema Assets:**
   - Discovered comprehensive database schema scripts in the main branch
   - Found `lot_tracking` table that partially supports batch management
   - Identified inventory, warehouses, and storage location tables in `02_inventory_tables.sql`

2. **Frontend Requirements:**
   - BatchManagementPage.js includes specialized features for fabric roll management
   - UI supports batch splitting, serial number tracking, and detailed inventory records
   - Mock data structures provide clear templates for required schema entities

3. **Schema-Frontend Gap Analysis:**
   - Need additional tables for serial number tracking
   - Need specialized tables for fabric roll tracking with splitting capability
   - Need to extend lot_tracking with additional attributes for batch management

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Schema Alignment
1. **Create TypeORM Entity Models** corresponding to:
   - Item categories and items
   - Lot tracking and inventory
   - Serial numbers for serialized inventory
   - Fabric rolls with specialized attributes
   - Parent-child relationships for split batches

2. **Schema Additions Required:**
   ```sql
   -- Serial Number Tracking
   CREATE TABLE serial_numbers (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       serial_number VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       item_id INTEGER REFERENCES items(id) NOT NULL,
       lot_id INTEGER REFERENCES lot_tracking(id),
       status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'available',
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );

   -- Fabric Roll Tracking (for specialized split functionality)
   CREATE TABLE fabric_rolls (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       lot_id INTEGER REFERENCES lot_tracking(id) NOT NULL,
       serial_number_id INTEGER REFERENCES serial_numbers(id),
       quantity DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
       width DECIMAL(10, 2),
       notes TEXT,
       parent_roll_id INTEGER REFERENCES fabric_rolls(id),
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```

#### Phase 2: Backend API Development
1. Create RESTful endpoints for:
   - Inventory item management
   - Batch/lot tracking operations
   - Serial number generation and management
   - Specialized fabric roll operations (including splitting)

2. Implement business logic for:
   - Inventory quantity tracking across batches
   - Validation for batch splitting operations
   - Historical transaction logging

#### Phase 3: Frontend Integration
1. Replace mock data providers with real API service calls
2. Implement proper error handling and loading states
3. Enhance UI for specialized batch operations

### Next Steps
1. Create TypeORM entity models for required tables
2. Generate migration scripts for schema additions
3. Implement backend API endpoints for batch management
4. Update frontend to connect with the new API endpoints

### Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Schema Alignment)**: Target completion - May 3, 2025
- **Phase 2 (Backend API)**: Target completion - May 7, 2025  
- **Phase 3 (Frontend Integration)**: Target completion - May 10, 2025
