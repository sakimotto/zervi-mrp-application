# Branch Information: local-modifications

## What We Did (April 10, 2025)

We created a separate branch called `local-modifications` to preserve local development work without interfering with the original codebase in the `main` branch. This was done instead of creating a fork because you already own the original repository.

### Key Local Changes Preserved:

1. **TypeScript Downgrade**:
   - Changed from version 5.8.2 to 4.9.5 in the frontend package-lock.json
   - Modified Node.js engine requirement from ">=14.17" to ">=4.2.0"

2. **Added New Implementation Files**:
   - `manus_package/` directory with implementation code and documentation
   - `zervi-minimal-backend/` directory with a lightweight backend implementation
   - Additional UI components in `zervi-ui-preview/bom/` and `zervi-ui-preview/operations/`
   - Various documentation files including implementation analysis and integration plans

## Why We Used Branches Instead of Forking

Since you are the owner of the original repository (`sakimotto/zervi-mrp-application`), creating a branch is more efficient than forking. This approach:
- Keeps all code in one repository
- Makes it easier to merge changes later if desired
- Provides cleaner version history

## How to Use This Branch

### Accessing the Branch

1. **On GitHub**:
   - Navigate to: https://github.com/sakimotto/zervi-mrp-application/tree/local-modifications

2. **Locally (Terminal)**:
   - Switch to this branch: `git checkout local-modifications`
   - Return to main branch: `git checkout main`

### Understanding the Differences

To see what changed between the branches:
```bash
git diff main..local-modifications
```

Or view specific file differences:
```bash
git diff main..local-modifications -- path/to/specific/file
```

## Working with This Branch in the Future

### From Another PC

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sakimotto/zervi-mrp-application.git
   ```

2. Check out the local-modifications branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout local-modifications
   ```

### Making Additional Changes

If you want to continue working on this branch:
1. Make sure you're on the branch: `git checkout local-modifications`
2. Make your changes
3. Commit: `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
4. Push: `git push origin local-modifications`

### If You Want to Merge Later

If you decide the modifications are valuable and want to integrate them into main:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge local-modifications
git push origin main
```

Alternatively, create a Pull Request on GitHub to review changes before merging.

## Key Technical Notes

1. The TypeScript downgrade (5.8.2 â†’ 4.9.5) may affect compatibility with newer features
2. Line ending differences (LF vs CRLF) were normalized during commit
3. The minimal backend implementation provides a simplified API for development and testing
