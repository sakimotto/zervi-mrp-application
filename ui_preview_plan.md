# UI Preview Plan for Zervi MRP Application

## Project Overview

The Zervi MRP (Manufacturing Resource Planning) application is designed to manage manufacturing operations across multiple divisions (Automotive, Camping, Apparel, Zervitek). This document outlines the approach for creating static UI previews of the application.

## Current Status

The project has completed the following milestones:

- Initial project setup and documentation
- Creation of main UI navigation and dashboard
- Development of division-specific interfaces
- Implementation of inventory management views
- Development of manufacturing interfaces (including routing and BOM management)
- Advanced BOM management tools (creation, costing, version comparison)
- Specialized manufacturing operations for textile production

## Next Steps

The following steps are planned for the UI preview development:

- User testing and feedback gathering
- Refinement based on stakeholder input
- Integration planning with backend services
- Documentation of UI components and patterns

## UI Preview Structure

The UI preview is organized into the following sections:

- Main navigation (index.html)
- Dashboard (dashboard/index.html)
- Manufacturing section
  - Manufacturing overview (manufacturing/index.html)
  - Bill of Materials (manufacturing/bom.html)
  - BOM Creation/Editing (manufacturing/bom-create.html)
  - BOM Costing Analysis (manufacturing/bom-costing.html)
  - BOM Version Comparison (manufacturing/bom-version-compare.html)
  - Production Routing (manufacturing/routing.html)
  - Specialized Operations (manufacturing/specialized-operations.html)
- Inventory (inventory/index.html)
- Divisions (divisions/index.html)
- Transfers (transfers/index.html)

## Implementation Details

The UI previews use HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript to demonstrate the application's interface. Material Design principles are followed for consistent styling and user experience.

## GitHub Integration

```javascript
// The repository is available at:
// https://github.com/sakimotto/zervi-mrp-application.git
```

## Feedback Process

Stakeholders can provide feedback by:

1. Viewing the static HTML files directly
2. Using the GitHub repository issues section
3. Scheduled review meetings with the development team
